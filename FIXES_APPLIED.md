# Neo CareerNest - Backend Fixes Applied

## Summary
Fixed critical backend errors in the service layer that were preventing proper job and internship creation/updates.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. JobService.java
**Location:** `careernestbackend/src/main/java/com/neoorganization/careernestbackend/service/JobService.java`

**Problems Found:**
- Line 39: Duplicate `setDescription()` call - should have been `setLocation()`
- Line 42: Duplicate `setSalaryMin()` call - should have been `setSalaryMax()`
- Line 65: Duplicate `setDescription()` call in updateJob - should have been `setLocation()`
- Line 68: Duplicate `setSalaryMin()` call in updateJob - should have been `setSalaryMax()`

**Impact:**
- Location field was never being saved when creating/updating jobs
- Salary maximum was never being saved (always null or previous value)
- This would cause issues when filtering jobs by location
- Salary ranges would be incorrect in the database

**Fixed By:**
- Replaced duplicate `setDescription()` with proper `setLocation(jobRequest.getLocation())`
- Replaced duplicate `setSalaryMin()` with proper `setSalaryMax(jobRequest.getSalaryMax())`
- Applied fixes to both `createJob()` and `updateJob()` methods

### 2. InternshipService.java
**Location:** `careernestbackend/src/main/java/com/neoorganization/careernestbackend/service/InternshipService.java`

**Problems Found:**
- Line 38: Duplicate `setDescription()` - should have been `setLocation()`
- Line 40: Another duplicate `setDescription()` - should have been `setDuration()`
- Line 41: Duplicate `setTitle()` - should have been `setType()`
- Line 47: Duplicate `setStartDate()` - should have been `setEndDate()`
- Lines 95-98: Duplicate method `getInternshipById(Object)` returning null
- Similar duplicate issues in `updateInternship()` method (lines 65, 67, 68, 74)

**Impact:**
- Location, duration, and type fields were never saved
- End date was never being saved (only start date)
- Internship filtering by location/type would fail
- Duration information would be lost
- Duplicate method could cause confusion and potential runtime errors

**Fixed By:**
- Replaced all duplicate setters with proper field assignments
- Removed the duplicate `getInternshipById(Object)` method
- Applied fixes to both `createInternship()` and `updateInternship()` methods

## Verification

### Compilation Status
✅ Backend compiles successfully with no errors
✅ All Java files pass compilation
✅ Maven build: SUCCESS

### Testing
✅ Backend starts successfully on port 8080
✅ Test endpoint `/api/auth/test` responds correctly
✅ Frontend starts successfully on port 3000
✅ Frontend can communicate with backend

## Files Modified
1. `careernestbackend/src/main/java/com/neoorganization/careernestbackend/service/JobService.java`
2. `careernestbackend/src/main/java/com/neoorganization/careernestbackend/service/InternshipService.java`

## New Files Created
1. `Start_Backend.bat` - Standalone backend starter
2. `Start_Frontend.bat` - Standalone frontend starter
3. `Start_Both.ps1` - PowerShell script to start both servers simultaneously
4. `FIXES_APPLIED.md` - This documentation file

## How to Run the Application

### Option 1: Start Both Servers Together (Recommended)
```powershell
.\Start_Both.ps1
```

### Option 2: Start Separately
**Terminal 1 - Backend:**
```batch
Start_Backend.bat
```

**Terminal 2 - Frontend:**
```batch
Start_Frontend.bat
```

### Option 3: Manual Start (Original Method)
Follow instructions in `Start_project.bat`

## Environment Requirements
- Java JDK 21.0.8 installed at: `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-21.0.8`
- Node.js installed at: `C:\Program Files\nodejs`
- MySQL running on localhost:3306
- Database: `neo_career_nest`
- MySQL credentials configured in `application.properties`

## API Endpoints
- Backend API Base: `http://localhost:8080/api`
- Frontend Application: `http://localhost:3000`

## Database Configuration
- Database Name: `neo_career_nest`
- Username: `root`
- Password: `Neo@2003` (as configured in application.properties)
- Auto-create database: Enabled
- Schema auto-update: Enabled (Hibernate DDL auto)

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Backend errors fixed and compiled
2. ✅ Both servers are running
3. ✅ Ready for testing
4. You can now:
   - Register new users
   - Post jobs and internships
   - Apply for positions
   - Use all application features

## Notes
- The backend uses JWT for authentication
- CORS is configured to allow requests from `http://localhost:3000` and `http://localhost:5173`
- All REST APIs follow the `/api/*` pattern
- Security is configured to permit all requests for easier development

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues:
1. Ensure MySQL is running and accessible
2. Check that ports 8080 and 3000 are not in use
3. Verify JAVA_HOME and Node.js are properly configured
4. Check the database connection in `application.properties`
5. Look for error logs in the console output
